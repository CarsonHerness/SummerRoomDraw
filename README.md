# SummerRoomDraw
Application for the Facilities and Maintenance Department that aides with Summer Room Draw at Harvey Mudd College.

This will automatically detect issues with students' housing requests, and will automatically preplace students who are not participating in Room Draw. Additionally, it will develop an order for Facilities to clean the rooms, creating a priority list for when the rooms are needed.

This application is necessary because Summer Room Draw is complicated due to how many different situations there are, with different dates and many different needs for each student. In the past, most of the work has been done by hand, but there is a lot of room for automation.
